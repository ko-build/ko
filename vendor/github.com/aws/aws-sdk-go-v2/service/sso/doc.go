// Package sso provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for AWS
// Single Sign-On.
//
// Amazon Web Services Single Sign On Portal is a web service that makes it easy
// for you to assign user access to Amazon Web Services SSO resources such as the
// AWS access portal. Users can get Amazon Web Services account applications and
// roles assigned to them and get federated into the application. Although Amazon
// Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and identitystore API
// namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward
// compatibility purposes. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SSO rename
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).
// This reference guide describes the Amazon Web Services SSO Portal operations
// that you can call programatically and includes detailed information on data
// types and errors. Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries
// and sample code for various programming languages and platforms, such as Java,
// Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create
// programmatic access to Amazon Web Services SSO and other Amazon Web Services
// services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how
// to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
