# Community

## Meetings

We have a bi-weekly community meeting on [Wednesdays at 1:00 PM US Eastern time, 10:00 AM US Western time](https://dateful.com/eventlink/2763257725). The main goal of these meetings is that we want to hear from you! We want to know what you're using `ko` for, what you'd like to see in `ko`, how we can make `ko` better for you. With any remaining time we can go through open issues and PRs.

We have a [meeting agenda](https://ko.build/agenda) you can use to propose topics for discussion/ideas. You can also just show up and we'll figure out what to talk about.

## Slack

Come discuss `ko` with us in the `#ko-build` channel on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://ko.build/slack)!
See you there!
